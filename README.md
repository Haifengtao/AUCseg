# AUCseg:An automatically unsupervised clustering toolbox for 3D-segmentation of High-grade gliomas on multi-parametric MR images 
## 1. Introduction
This is an automatically unsupervised clustering toolbox for 3D-segmentation of High-grade gliomas on multi-parametric MR images. 

## 2. Preprocess 
### 2.1 Skull stripping.
Skull will impact the segmentation result.
### 2.2 Registration 
Our method will use the multi-parametric MR images, so we need register them. In theory, rigid registration is enough.

## 3. Requirements
None
## 4. How to use
easy

## 5. How to cite
None
